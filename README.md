## Bitcoin Faucet Rotator

Copyright (c) 2015, Robert Attfield (www.robertattfield.com).

After months of residing in a private repository, and self-deliberation to whether this should be a paid-for script, I have finally decided to make this project open-source!

This script enables you to start your very own bitcoin faucet rotator, for which you can earn varying amounts of referral income. 

The Twitter Integration enables faucets to be tweeted when they are added and updated. Every hour, a faucet is chosen at random and tweeted.

The main purpose of this script is to allow 'small-time'/beginner bitcoin enthusiasts to earn free bitcoins faster than manually surfing hundreds of bitcoin faucets. With a solid marketing campaign, your referral income is limited only by your potential. If you are new to Bitcoins, you can view [their official documentation](https://bitcoin.org/en/) to find out more.

As I am more of a back-end developer, the client-facing design, look and feel of the script is quite 'simple'. While I seem to follow the 'simple is best' approach, I strongly encourage any contribution that will visually enhance this script.

## Official Documentation

For installation instructions, please view the INSTALL.md file. I will be making a blog post for instructions on my personal site ASAP.

### <a name="commenting">Commenting</a>
To help other potential contributors (as well as myself) understand what you have contributed, please comment your code. 
Suggested examples can be viewed at http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/getting-started/your-first-set-of-documentation.html.

### <a name="php_coding_standards">PHP Coding Standards</a>
As I want to increase the quality of my code, I plan to use relevant PHP coding standards from http://www.php-fig.org/psr/ (at least up to PSR4).

### <a name="software_design_principles">Software Design Principles</a>
I also will do my best to adhere to relevant software design principles - a good reference for these is http://www.oodesign.com/design-principles.html. 
Some good examples of software design principles, in PHP, can be seen at http://code.tutsplus.com/series/the-solid-principles--cms-634.

### <a name="software_design_patterns">Software Design Patterns</a>
Where appropriate, I also plan to enhance code quality by making the most out of Object-Oriented Design Patterns. Some excellent examples can 
be found at https://github.com/domnikl/DesignPatternsPHP.

#### <a name="php_code_base">PHP Code Base</a>
For testing PHP classes, functions, code logic, etc, I plan to use PHPUnit. If you don't know what PHPUnit is, you can visit the vendor website 
at https://phpunit.de/ - examples of it's use in Laravel 5+ can be seen at https://laraveltips.wordpress.com/category/phpunit-testing-in-laravel-5-1/.

#### <a name="jquery_vanilla_javascript">JQuery/Vanilla Javascript</a>
Up until now, I haven't seriously considered unit testing any of my Javascript/JQuery code (probably because my speciality is back-end server-side code). 
That is a bad thing on my part, so I plan on starting now. Upon a quick glance, QUnit (http://qunitjs.com/) provides an excellent framework for testing - 
some excellent examples can be directly accessed at http://qunitjs.com/intro/. The 'Intro' section is comprehensive, so will be looked upon very often.
